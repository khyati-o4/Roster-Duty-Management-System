# ROASTER DUTY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# Abstract

The academic system requires a lot of paper labour, which frequently causes confusion when files or papers containing pertinent records are misplaced. Staff duty records are also kept on paper, which is inefficient because it causes delays in finding the necessary documents and compromises the security of the data. Lack of a web-based system for staff duty record keeping makes it challenging to: conveniently manage staff duty record keeping, preserve the records, easily update the records, and obtain necessary reports right away.
The aim of the study is to develop a web-based staff duty record management system for the organization. The following are the specific objectives needed to realize the aim:
1.	To develop a web-based system that will aid the easy registration of assigned staff and their details to database.
2.	To develop a system that can be utilized to obtain reports pertain to staff on duties on respective dates

# Result Discussion

In this project, first of all a login home page is created and is linked to mysql database. Whenever a new user trys to login , he or she is redirected to employee form page to signup to the portal with one’s details required and to confirm with password newly created. 

Once the user has signed up, his or her details are sent to the employee database connected in MySQL and is saved there. Further, the user is redirected to enter the profile by logging in through username and password that is saved in the employee database. If the user entered wrong username or password, the user is redirected to the same login page and is alerted with a message of wrong credentials and asks to try again. Once, the user has entered the corrected credentials, he or she is directed to the employee-profile page or the admin-profile page according to what the user selected while signing up the registration form. If the user is admin, he logs in to the admin handle page where he can see and manage all the staff details, registrations and also add , update or delete details as per requirement. Added to this, the admin can switch over to the assign page where he can select the userID from the given dropdown links and a date from the calendar to add the employees on duty on a particular day that gets displayed for the admin as well as the employee on their login portal. If the user is employee, he or she logs in to see the employess who are on duty on specified date so that they can meet up the requirements altogether as per requirement.

This method improves productivity and convenience for both the administrative handler and the employee user, lessens the need for tedious manual labour, improves communication, and makes it simpler to handle and manage any organization's whole workforce.
